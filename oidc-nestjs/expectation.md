Currently I have 2 folder: admin & oidc-provider that

- oidc-provider is NodeJS simple express connect to database MySQL and implement oidc-provider npm package.
- admin is react project to testing authentication login with that service.

Expectation:

- Now i want implement with NestJS with well architected like ABP framework structure database.
- Have set up migration database.
- Naming convention in MySQL database is use "snake_case" not use "camelCase".
- use latest version npm packages.
